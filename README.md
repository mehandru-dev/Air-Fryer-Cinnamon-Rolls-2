DIRECTIONS
-Make rolls: Line bottom of air fryer with parchment paper and brush with butter. In a medium bowl, combine butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and a large pinch of salt until smooth and fluffy.

-On a lightly floured surface, roll out crescent rolls in one piece. Pinch seams together and fold in half. Roll into a 9"-x-7" rectangle. Spread butter mixture over dough, leaving 1/4-inch border. Starting at a long edge, roll up dough like a jelly roll, then cut crosswise into 6 pieces. 

-Arrange pieces in prepared air fryer, cut-side up, spaced evenly.

-Set air fryer to 350Â°, and cook until golden and cooked through, about 10 minutes. 

-Make the glaze: In a medium bowl, Whisk cream cheese, powdered sugar, and milk together. Add more milk by the teaspoonful, if necessary, to thin glaze. 

-Spread glaze over warm cinnamon rolls and serve.
